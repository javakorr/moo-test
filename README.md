## Requirements:
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) v2.0.0 and up.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [browserify](http://browserify.org) should be installed globally if you have any related
 errors when running the app.

## Usage:
1. Clone repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. There are two versions available for this app:
    * [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) — run `npm start`.
    * [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org) — run `npm run start:angular`.
4. The app will open in your default browser (if you're lucky enough).

To clear posts, run `localStorage.clear()` in your browser developer console.
